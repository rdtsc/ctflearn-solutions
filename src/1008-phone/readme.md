## Description

My boss was calling me yesterday but I wasn't able to answer the phone. He left
me an encoded message in the voicemail. There are a lot of weird sounds going
on. I have to know what he wanted to tell me. Could you help me decode it? I bet
it's something important.

Here is the [audio file](./extra/recording.wav) from my voicemail.
