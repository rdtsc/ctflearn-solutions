**Programming – Hard – Problem #670**

## Description

I was sent [this picture](./extra/image.png) by an unknown individual, and after
putting it through a hex editor, I found nothing out of the ordinary hidden
inside. A message came with the image saying, "Can You Read Me?" Could you help
me figure out what the hidden message says?? I can't figure out another way to
read the image! Maybe Python's Pillow library can help you out?
