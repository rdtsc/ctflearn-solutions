## Description

My friend is a data-scientist and he spends his days using Excel or cool python
libraries like numpy, pandas, or opencv. But this morning he was feeling grumpy
and hid my flag in [a CSV](./extra/data.csv).

The only thing he told me is that *the real hint will be given when you find
what the columns mean*.
