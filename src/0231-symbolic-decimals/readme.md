**Cryptography – Hard – Problem #231**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/231`


## Description

Did you know that you can hide messages with symbols? For example, `!@#$%^&*()`
is `1234567890`!

Now try:

```text
^&,*$,&),!@#,*#,!!^,(&,!!$,(%,$^,(%,*&,(&,!!$,!!%,(%,$^,(%,&),!!!,!!$,(%,$^,(%,&^,!)%,!)@,!)!,!@%
```

However, this isn't as easy as you might think.
