**Programming – Hard – Problem #161**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/161`


## Description

My boss started passing all of [his messages](./extra/message.txt) through some
[obfuscation software](./extra/app.py), and I think he's got some information
involving my salary in one of those files down there -- or maybe he's just
messing around.

Either way, can you figure out what's up?
