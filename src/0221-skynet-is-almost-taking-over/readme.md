# Skynet Is (Almost) Taking Over

**Cryptography – Hard – Problem #221**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/221`


## Description

Skynet is using a very small list of primes for RSA style encryption purposes.
In fact their list is only the size of the smallest odd prime.

One of the robots sent a message to three other robots. These are futuristic
robots with the ability to use quantum computing and so they don't mind prime
factoring huge numbers. You can't do that though. Find out what message the
robot [sent to his friends](./extra/data.txt).

The flag is in `flag{}` format.
