# Defying Hell

**Cryptography – Hard – Problem #927**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/927`


## Description

Alice has been sharing secret encrypted messages with Bob. I would really like
to know what those are...

I contacted my good friend Eve, a well-known eavesdropper. She sent me [the
numbers she found](./extra/data.txt) at the beginning of their conversation. By
the look of things, this looks like a key exchange. If we would find the key, we
would be able to decode every message they encrypted with it!

Help me find both private keys. To submit the flag, decode them correctly and
wrap them into `CTFlearn{<Alice>_<Bob>}` format.

Hint: the title of this challenge is a pun... I can't tell you more ;)
