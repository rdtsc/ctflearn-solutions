# The Safest Encryption

**Cryptography – Medium – Problem #1092**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/1092`


## Description

I intercepted [this zip file](./extra/archive.zip). The contents seem to be
encrypted, but it looks like the key is also in there.

Could you try recovering the encrypted file?
