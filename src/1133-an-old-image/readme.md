# An Old Image

**Programming – Medium – Problem #1133**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/1133`


## Description

I've been storing this image as a table for a very long time.

The table has four columns – `x`, `y`, `red`, `green`.

When I recreated the image from the table, the columns seemed to have gotten
mixed up!

Could you recreate [the image](./extra/image.png)?
