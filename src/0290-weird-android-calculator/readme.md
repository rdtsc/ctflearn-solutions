**Programming – Medium – Problem #290**

## Description

I've found this very weird android application.

Seems to be some [kind of calculator](./extra/WeirdCalculator.apk), but there
is something strange with it. Can you find out what it is?

Flag is in Format: FLAG{...}

Note: You don't really need an android device to solve this. But it might be
helpful :)
