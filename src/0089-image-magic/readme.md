# Image Magic

**Programming – Hard – Problem #89**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/89`


## Description

It looks like someone messed up [my picture](./extra/image.jpg)! Can anyone
reorganize the pixels? The python module PIL (Python Imaging Library) might be
useful!

Update: I think whoever messed up my image took every column of pixels and put
them side by side. Update: I think the width of the image was 304 before they
messed with it.
