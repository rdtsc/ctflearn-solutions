**Cryptography – Medium – Problem #263**

## Description

Ever heard of the 5x5 secret message system? If not, basically it's a 5x5 grid
with all letters of the alphabet in order, without `k` because `c` is
represented to make the `k` sound only. Google it if you need to.

A letter is identified by Row-Column. All values are in caps. Try:

```text
1-3,4-4,2-1,{,4-4,2-3,4-5,3-2,1-2,4-3,_,4-5,3-5,}
```
