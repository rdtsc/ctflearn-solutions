## Description

Here is [a list of employees](./extra/input.txt).

Their task is to keep a vault safe. No one knows the key to open the vault, but
each one of them has a secret key.

In order to open the vault, any 3 of them have to meet and put their keys
together. By doing so, they will get the key to open the vault.

Given the secret key of each employee, can you figure out the key to open the
vault?
