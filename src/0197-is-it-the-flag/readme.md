# Is It the Flag? (JAVA)

**Programming – Hard – Problem #197**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/197`


## Description

Pedro was disappointed because he didn't speak Python well enough to capture
some of the flags on CTFLearn. His plan for revenge was to
[create one](./extra/IsItTheFlag.java) in his native language (Java).
The flag is a String of 6 alphanumeric characters. Capture it.
