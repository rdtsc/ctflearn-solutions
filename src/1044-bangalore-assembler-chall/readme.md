# Bangalore Assembler Chall

**Programming – Easy – Problem #1044**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/1044`


## Description

This is the 3rd in a series of Beginner Assembly Language programming
challenges. This challenge is all about the stack. Correctly add/modify/remove
push and pop instructions to the 4 subroutines Step1/2/3/4 in `Bangalore.asm`
and the flag will be written to stdout. Good Luck!

The file 'tutorial' in the [zip file](./extra/bundle.zip) contains references to
online resources to learn about the stack for people new to Assembly Language
programming. I also created a small tutorial with 3 short .asm programs showing
how registers should be saved on the stack within a subroutine.
