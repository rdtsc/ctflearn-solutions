# Tony Stark's Message

**Programming – Medium – Problem #986**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/986`


## Description

After the Snap, Tony Stark and Nebula, were the only survivors on Titan. Lost in
deep space for more than 20 days. As essentials are running out, Tony records
his last message into the mask. But as fate happens, Captain Marvel recues Tony
and Nebula. Later on, some [weird data](./extra/data.txt) was found in the logs
of Jarvis. The data was compressed. After looking at the data closely I found
out that compression was lossless and was based on frequency of characters.
Also, [node data](./extra/node.pickle) is pickled. When I decoded the data and
read it, I was emotional. I can't exactly explain what I was feeling, but you
will know what I felt, when you decode the data.
