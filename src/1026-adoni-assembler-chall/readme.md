# Adoni Assembler Chall

**Programming – Easy – Problem #1026**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/1026`


## Description

This is an introductory Assembler programming challenge for anyone who has
always wanted to begin learning 64 bit Intel Assembler.
[adoni.asm](./extra/adoni.asm) file provided compiles and links but does not
provide the flag. You have to edit the `adoni.asm` file and change it to display
the flag. There is a [readme file](./extra/notes.txt) with 4 videos to watch
that provide enough information to add some assembler instructions to the file
and compile and link and run your first Assembler program.

Adoni is a city in India and the flag is related to the city.
