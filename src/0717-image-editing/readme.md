# Image Editing

**Cryptography – Hard – Problem #717**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/717`


## Description

I sent a couple of images to my friend, Leslie S. Brown, to edit. The only
problem is that she only sent back [one image](./extra/image.png)!

Can you help me figure out what happened to the other image? Also, for whatever
reason, the image has a red tinge to it.
