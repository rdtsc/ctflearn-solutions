## Description

Hey! I have [intercepted this](./extra/image.png) from the Center for
Interesting Arrangements. Out of all the documents the CIA holds, this seems to
stand out because I don't see any "interesting arrangement" in this image.

Pretty sure that this is just a bunch of noise... or is it? Look at this file
closely and you'll (definitely) agree with me!
