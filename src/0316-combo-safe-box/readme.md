**Miscellaneous – Hard – Problem #316**

## Description

My friend likes to keep secret stuff inside a safe-box.

I have kept bugging him for the combination to the safe. He finally gave
[this file](./extra/safe.pptx) to me. When I opened it I got this puzzling combo
box. He told me: "Follow the links down the rabbit-hole! There's only one
correct path!"

Can you figure out the combination safe lock?
