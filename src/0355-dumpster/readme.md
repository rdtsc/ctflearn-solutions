# Dumpster

**Forensics – Medium – Problem #355**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/355`


## Description

I found a flag, but it was encrypted! Our systems have detected that someone has
successfully decrypted this flag, and we stealthily took a
[heap dump](./extra/heap.hprof) of [the program](./extra/app.java) (in Java).

Can you recover the flag for me?
