# Android, Run!

**Miscellaneous – Hard – Problem #317**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/317`


## Description

Spawn, run, sleep, write, terminate. This is an Android RE challenge, and a
little bit more than that.

If you want to run the application, but don't have an Android smartphone, you
can, for example, use GenyMotion to emulate a device.

[Here](./extra/app.apk) is the APK.
