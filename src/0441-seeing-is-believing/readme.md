**Forensics – Hard – Problem #441**

## Description

My colleague's an astronaut who's currently on a mission orbiting in space. Just
a few hours ago, unfortunately, his communication device caught fire so he's
unable to report back to base. I did, however, receive
[a strange file](./extra/message.zip) that I can't seem to open. I think it may
shed some light on his situation. Can you help me save poor boy Johnny?
