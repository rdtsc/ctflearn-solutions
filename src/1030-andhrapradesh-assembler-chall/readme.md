# AndhraPradesh Assembler Chall

**Programming – Easy – Problem #1030**

`https://ctflearn.com/challenge/1030`


## Description

This is another beginner Assembly Language Programming Challenge. If you have
never written any Assembler but always wanted to, this challenge is for you.

Modify the 5 (unsigned) constants at the top of
[AndhraPradesh.asm](./extra/AndhraPradesh.asm) then compile, link and run to
find the flag. A script is provided to compile, link and run the program. The
program exits with different error codes when the constants are incorrect. A
[readme](./extra/notes.txt) is provided with more details and references to
internet tutorials on Assembler programming.

This challenge involves the `je`, `jne`, `ja`, `jb` instructions. The `ah` and
`al` registers are also used. Unsigned register values are used to allow for
easier inspection of register values in gdb.

Good Luck!
